### Method 2: Manual Cookie Extractor

Run the cookie extractor from the command line:

```bash
# Automatic (tries Edge, then Chrome, then Firefox)
python cookie_extractor.py

# Only from Edge
python cookie_extractor.py --browser edge

# Only from Chrome
python cookie_extractor.py --browser chrome

# Only from Firefox
python cookie_extractor.py --browser firefox
```

### Method 3: Browser Extension

```
# Netscape HTTP Cookie File

## Building Executable

To create standalone executables for all platforms:

### ü™ü Windows
```bash
# Method 1: Using build script (Recommended)
build_exe.bat

# Method 2: Manual build
pip install pyinstaller
python -c "from downloader import Downloader; d = Downloader(); d.setup_ffmpeg()"
pyinstaller youtube_downloader.spec --clean --noconfirm
```

### üêß Linux
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build_linux.sh

# Run build script
./build_linux.sh

# Manual build
pip3 install pyinstaller
python3 -c "from downloader import Downloader; d = Downloader(); d.setup_ffmpeg()"
pyinstaller youtube_downloader_linux.spec --clean --noconfirm
```

### üçé macOS
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build_macos.sh

# Run build script
./build_macos.sh

# Manual build
pip3 install pyinstaller
python3 -c "from downloader import Downloader; d = Downloader(); d.setup_ffmpeg()"
pyinstaller youtube_downloader_macos.spec --clean --noconfirm
```

### üöÄ Automated Multi-Platform Release

For maintainers to create releases for all platforms:

```bash
# Prepare and create a new release
python prepare_release.py --version patch

# Options:
# --version major|minor|patch (default: patch)
# --dry-run (preview changes)
# --skip-build (skip local build test)
# --force (ignore uncommitted changes)
```

This will:
1. Create a new version tag
2. Push to GitHub
3. Trigger GitHub Actions to build for Windows, Linux, and macOS
4. Automatically create a GitHub release with all executables
